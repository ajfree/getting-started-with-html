  <h1>Learn how the Web Works</h1>

<body>When working with the internet, there are things behind the scene 
that put a web page together. <br><br>
 <p> <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>, commonly referred to as <em>HTML</em>, 
 is the standard markup language used to create web pages. 
 <br>It is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets.</p>

<b>Tags & Elements</b>
<p>Tags mark the beginning and end of an element.<br> 
Elements are the bits that make up web pages and 
refer to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.</p>

<b>Blocks & Incline</b>
<p>Block elements are placed to start a new line. 
Blocks may contain other blocks, as well as inline elements and data (content).<br>
Inline elements are used to display on the same line and  may contain only data and other inline elements.</p></body>
